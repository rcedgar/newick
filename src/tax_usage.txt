newick 
	-tax trees.newick \				# INPUT one or more rooted binary trees, suggest just one to KISS
	-features feature_table.tsv \	# INPUT feature table (see below)
	-tsv results.tsv \				# OUTPUT results in tab-separated text format
	-fev results.fev \				# OUTPUT results in "field=value" format
	-out annotated.newick \			# OUTPUT annotated tree -- I forget what this is :-)

All OUTPUT options are optional :-)

Each taxon is matched to the tree by finding a best-fit LCA
  node which minimizes FP+FN errors.
	FP = leaf in LCA's subtree belongs to a different taxon.
	FN = species in the taxon not in the LCA's subtree.

Output files report TPs and FPs for each taxon, and summary for the whole tree

Feature table:
Specifies taxon for each leaf label in the tree.
Format is tab-separated text with two fields:
	1. leaf_label, 2. taxon

Putting taxon names in labels:
It can be nice to put taxon names in the tree label, e.g. A1234_Pisuviricota,
where A1234 = Genbank ID and Pisuviricota = taxon. Then you can  quickly
visualize in a tree viewer such as Dendroscope to see whether taxa are
grouping together. If you do this, then you don't need to give a feature
table, instead you tell newick where the taxon name is by using the -ff
option. This has two characters: 1. integer field number, 2. separator
character. For labels formatted like A1234_Pisuviricota, you would
use -ff 2_ (second field, fields separated by underscore).

All of this is for a single rank e.g. phylum or family. Typically, one
rank is the "sweet spot" -- lower ranks are too easy, higher ranks are
too hard. To measure multiple ranks, you will need different feature
tables.

You need a rooted tree, there is a -rootbyoutgroup command to do rooting by taxonomic outgroup
newick -rootbyoutgroup trees.newick -output rooted.newick
If the outgroup is a single leaf, you can specify it by -label outgroupname
If the group is one or more leaves, specify by -labels outgrouplabels.txt
